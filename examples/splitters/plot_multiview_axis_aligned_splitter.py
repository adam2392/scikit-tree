Demonstrate and visualize a multi-view projection matrix for an axis-aligned tree
=================================================================================

This example shows how multi-view projection matrices are generated for a decision tree,
specifically the :class:`sktree.tree.MultiViewDecisionTreeClassifier`.

Multi-view projection matrices operate under the assumption that the input ``X`` array
consists of multiple feature-sets that are groups of features important for predicting
``y``.

For details on how to use the hyperparameters related to the multi-view, see
:class:`sktree.tree.MultiViewDecisionTreeClassifier`.

# import modules
# .. note:: We use a private Cython module here to demonstrate what the patches
#           look like. This is not part of the public API. The Cython module used
#           is just a Python wrapper for the underlying Cython code and is not the
#           same as the Cython splitter used in the actual implementation.
#           To use the actual splitter, one should use the public API for the
#           relevant tree/forests class.

# Initialize the multi-view splitter
# ----------------------------------
# The multi-view splitter is a Cython class that is initialized internally
# in scikit-tree. However, we expose a Python tester object to demonstrate
# how the splitter works in practice.
#
# .. warning:: Do not use this interface directly in practice.

# Sample the projection matrix
# ----------------------------

# matrix is a (max_features, n_features) matrix that selects which features of ``X``
# to define candidate split dimensions. The multi-view
# splitter's projection matrix though samples from multiple feature sets,
# which are aligned contiguously over the columns of ``X``.

# Discussion
# ----------
# As we can see, the multi-view splitter samples split candidates uniformly across the feature sets.
# In contrast, the normal splitter in :class:`sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier` samples
# randomly across all ``n_features`` features because it is not aware of the multi-view structure.
# This is the key difference between the two splitters.
