Version 0.9
===========

**In Development**

Changelog
---------

- |API| :class:`sktree.tree.MultiViewDecisionTreeClassifier` do not have the
    ``apply_max_features_per_feature_set`` argument anymore. Instead, the
    ``max_features`` argument is used to control the number of features to
    consider when looking for the best split within each feature set explicitly.
    By `Adam Li`_ :pr:`#265`.

- |Feature| :class:`sktree.tree.MultiViewObliqueDecisionTreeClassifier` is implemented
    along with its forest version :class:`sktree.MultiViewObliqueRandomForestClassifier`.
    By `Adam Li`_ :pr:`#265`.
